# Myth Busters

Bust common animal myths in this trivia game! This game was made for The Odin Project's [first game jam](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1) with the theme Edutainment.

## How to Play

Choose from the four categories (mammals, birds, fishes or reptiles and amphibians) and start busting some myths!

## Game Modes

### Easy 

You will be presented with a statement and you have to decide if it's true or a myth. It's that simple!

### Hard

Same gameplay but with a twist! Aside from the first statement, you'll also get what we call a "twister". You'll also be given a "law prompt" at top of "question statement" and you'll need to decide where those two statements in our "truth-table" falls into and decide it's outcome.

## Example
### Easy

- **Question Statement:** Humans are mammals
- **Explanation:** Yes, humans fall under Mammals category among animal kingdom
- **Correct Answer:** True

### Hard

- **Law Used:** Implication Rule
- **Question Statement (A):** Humans are mammals  ⇒  True
- **Twister Statement (B):** Humans can also breath under water  ⇒  False
- **Explanation:** Here A does not imply B so implication of A and B is False  ⇒  e.g. True and False "implies" False
- **Correct Answer:** False
